abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have advanced our ability to take DNA primary
  sequence as input and predict a myriad of molecular activities measured via high-throughput
  functional genomic assays. Post hoc attribution analysis has been employed to provide
  insights into the importance of features learned by DNNs, often revealing patterns
  such as  sequence motifs. However, attribution maps typically harbor spurious importance
  scores to an extent that varies from model to model, even for DNNs whose predictions
  generalize well. Thus, the standard approach for model selection, which relies on
  performance of a held-out validation set, does not guarantee that a high-performing
  DNN will provide reliable explanations. Here we introduce two approaches that quantify
  the consistency of important features across a population of attribution maps; consistency
  reflects a qualitative property of human interpretable attribution maps. We employ
  the consistency metrics as part of a multivariate model selection framework to identify
  models that yield high generalization performance and interpretable attribution
  analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach across various DNNs quantitatively
  with synthetic data and qualitatively with chromatin accessibility data.
