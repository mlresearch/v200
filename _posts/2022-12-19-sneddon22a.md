abstract: 'Algorithms developed for basecalling Nanopore signals have primarily focused
  on DNA to date and utilise the raw signal as the only input.  However, it is known
  that messenger RNA (mRNA), which dominates Nanopore direct RNA (dRNA) sequencing
  libraries, contains specific nucleotide patterns that are implicitly encoded in
  the Nanopore signals since RNA is always sequenced from the 3’ to 5’ direction.  In
  this study we present an approach to exploit the sequence biases in mRNA as an additional
  input to dRNA basecalling.  We developed a probabilistic model of mRNA language
  and propose a modified CTC beam search decoding algorithm to conditionally incorporate
  the language model during basecalling.  Our findings demonstrate that inclusion
  of mRNA language is able to guide CTC beam search decoding towards the more probable
  nucleotide sequence.  We also propose a time efficient approach to decoding variable
  length nanopore signals.  This work provides the first demonstration of the potential
  for biological language to inform Nanopore basecalling.  Code is available at: https://github.com/a-sneddon/radian.'
